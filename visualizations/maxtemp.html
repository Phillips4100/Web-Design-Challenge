        Latitude is one of the primary factors that affect temperature. As one moves further away from the equator, the temperature falls because regions receive less sunlight. The reason behind this is the shape of the earth. The shape of the earth is an oblate spheroid. Thus, not all locations receive the same amount of sunlight heat or insolation (Incoming Solar Radiation). Another reason for the difference in temperatures varying with latitude is the angle of solar incidence. The rays from the sun strike the surface of the earth at different angles. At the equator, the incidence of the sun's rays are at a right angle, and this translates to more heat because they are concentrated over a small area. It also implies that less heat is lost in the atmosphere because they travel a short distance in the atmosphere. On the other hand, at the poles, the sun rays strike the surface of the earth at an acute angle. The rays from the sun are dispersed over a large area. This also implies that more heat is lost in the atmosphere because they travel long distances over the atmosphere before it hits the earthâ€™s surface.
        The Tropics
        The tropics or the tropical zone refers to the region that surrounds the equator. To the north, it is delimited by the tropic of Cancer that corresponds to the latitude 23.436720North in the Northern Hemisphere. To the south, it is delimited by the tropic of Capricorn that corresponds to the latitude 23.436720South in the Southern Hemisphere. The tropics are comprised of regions on earth where the sun shines directly overhead once in a year. The tropical zone accounts for 40% of the surface of the earth and has 36% of the landmass.
